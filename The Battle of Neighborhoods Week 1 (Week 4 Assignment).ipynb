    "# An Introdunction To The Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A Tennis academy located in Flushing Meadows, New York, is planning to organize a number of tournaments, coaching courses, seminars and workshops for professional tennis players and coaches from all over the world during the next few months. Most of the players and coaches participating in an event will require lodging and dining facilities throughout the duration of the event. Additionally, the administration of the academy has decided that a gymming facility shall also be made available to the participants. But, the academy does not have any facilities for the lodging, dining or gymming of the participants. So, after a number of meetings, the administration has decided that the academy shall collaborate with a few hotels, restaurants and gyms within a specified radius of the academy in order to provide the participants with the required facilities. The participants will be given a list and a map of all the hotels, restaurants and gyms that are located within the specified radius and will be able to choose amongst them. The academy has hired a Data Scientist and given him the following objectives to fulfill:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   1. Identify atleast 10 Hotels within a 1.5 KM radius of the academy.\n",
    "   2. Identify atleast 10 Restaurants within a 500 meter radius of the academy.\n",
    "   3. Identify atleast 3 gyms within a 3 KM radius of the academy.\n",
    "   4. Visualize the locations identified on one single map. \n",
